  Here is my basic site tutorial with github site creation and atom integration
  <ol>
    <li>Download and install atom for windows (or mac, this tutorial focuses on windows)</li>
    <li>Download and install git, I recommend git from command prompt, instead of bash</li>
    <li>Register for github.com with student email, I recommend a short username, if possible</li>
    <li>
      Create a new repo with the exact name as your username, plus github.io.. username.github.io
    </li>
    <li>
      Press WindowsKey+R on windows and type "cmd" then enter (to open the command prompt)
    </li>
    <li>
      type: git config --global user.name "(YourGithubUsername)"
    </li>
    <li>
      For github to function, the files in a cloud repository are replicated to your local machine, and update are typically made manually.
      <br />You will need to relaunch atom
    </li>
    <li>
      In atom, press ctrl+shift+8 (to open the github tab)
    </li>
    <li>

    </li>
  </ol>
