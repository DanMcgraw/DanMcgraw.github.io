  Here is my basic site tutorial with github site creation and atom integration
  <ol>
    <li>Download and install atom for windows (or mac, this tutorial focuses on windows)</li>
    <li>If you are not using a school computer, download and install git, I recommend git from command prompt, instead of bash</li>
    <li>Register for github.com with student email, I recommend a short username, if possible</li>
    <li>
      Create a new repo with the exact name as your username, plus github.io.. username.github.io
    </li>
    <li>
      Press WindowsKey+R on windows and type "cmd" then enter (to open the command prompt)
    </li>
    <li>
      type: git config --global user.name "(YourGithubUsername)"
    </li>
    <li>
      For github to function, the files in a cloud repository are replicated to your local machine, and update are typically made manually.
      <br />You will need to relaunch atom
    </li>
    <li>
      In atom, press ctrl+shift+p, then type git clone
    </li>
    <li>
      Paste your github https url for your website repo. It should be: https://github.com/username/username.github.io.git <br />This you will need to replicate your github project from the cloud to your local machine.
    </li>
    <li>
      In atom, press ctrl+shift+8 (to open the github tab) and login to your github account, you may need to generate and paste an authentication token for github.
    </li>
    <li>
      Create a file in the root folder (not in the .git folder!) named index.html. This will be your homepage by default.
    </li>
    <li>
      Before adding any html, I would recommend getting these optional packages using this package installation procedure:<br />
ctrl+shift+p<br />install package<br />Add the following:
      <ul>
        <li>atom-beautify by Glavin001 (over 5 million downloads) you will need to open it's settings, scroll to html, and check beautify on save</li>
        <li>autocomplete-html-entities by lee-dohm, or autoclose-html by mattberkowitz these will automatically place your ending tags for better nesting and quicker coding</li>
        <li>w3c-validation by leny, this package uses an application that is required for debugging our homework assignments, it says most warnings regarding your code structure</li>
        <li>feel free to find anymore that are convenient to your liking, most of these packages are very useful and customizable</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Feel free to customize any of these packages to your liking later
    </li>
    <li>
      Hit ctrl+shift+9, double click any changed files you would like to "push" to the git repository
    </li>
    <li>
      Name your update. Since it is the first commit, it is typically named "Initial Commit". This is a descriptor of what you have done in your current session, it is important to note this in github so your groupmates have an idea of what you did,
      which is a helpful form of communication in a group project.
    </li>
    <li>
      Press ctrl+enter
    </li>
    <li>
      Beneath the commit message, in the bottom corner of the screen, locate the "Push #" button. Click it.
    </li>
    <li>
      To verify changes were made, goto your github repo by the website and refresh. You should now be able to access your website by username.github.io
<br /> Another way to refresh if you do not see your changes made may be because your browser is caching the site. Typically you are able to reload the entire page by hitting shift+F5
    </li>
  </ol>
